# House_Price_Prediction
This Machine Learning project uses Linear Regression to predict house prices based on area. It includes data visualization, model training, evaluation, and real-time price prediction using Python.

# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices based on area (in square feet) using a simple **Linear Regression** model implemented in Python.

## Project Overview
- Input: House Area (sqft)
- Output: Estimated Price (in Lakhs)
- Algorithm: Linear Regression
- Language: Python

## Dataset
The dataset is manually created and contains:
- Area_sqft: Size of the house
- Price_lakhs: Price of the house in lakhs

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkshayMundra19/House-Price-Prediction-ML.git
